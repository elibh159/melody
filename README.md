# Directory structure/project

React doesn’t have opinions on how you put files into folders. there are a few common approaches popular in the ecosystem:

- Grouping by feature or routes
- Grouping by file type

**Colocation**: it is a good idea to keep files that often change together close to each other. This principle is called “Colocation”.

In this project I used **Group by feature or routes**. In this way all of file related a component (sass, test, …) is in the same folder.
